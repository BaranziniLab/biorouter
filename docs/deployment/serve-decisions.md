Biorouter can be reached from an ordinary web browser: `biorouter serve` starts the daemon,
hands it the built interface, and prints a URL. Before this existed, the same job was done by a
separate `biorouter-headless` binary that spawned the daemon and reverse-proxied it — shipped
only as a Linux tarball, and only to a provisioned server.

This page records the decisions that replaced that arrangement. They were taken together, and
several of them only make sense as a set: the reason a browser session cannot switch models
(SD-1) is also the reason it needs no proof-of-user mechanism, which is the reason the daemon
can be spawned with a closed stdin (SD-7) — and the reason every control that needs that proof
must say so before the user reaches for it (SD-8). Read [the architecture](serve-architecture.md)
for how the result is built, and [browser access](browser-access.md) for how to use it.

Records are identified `SD-n` — *serve decision*. The numbering is stable; a superseded record
keeps its number and says what replaced it.

## SD-1 — A browser session cannot change its model or provider, and that is the point

**Ruling.** `POST /config/provider` continues to refuse a request that carries no proof a human
made it. Browser-served Biorouter installs no such proof. A browser session therefore runs
whatever provider and model the machine was already configured with, and the model picker is
inert.

**Why.** This looks like a missing feature and is actually the privacy boundary holding. The
privacy tier system (issue #56) classifies a conversation by the sensitivity of what it has
touched, and a session that has reached a private model may never later reach a public one. The
guarantee rests on knowing which model a conversation ran against. If a browser tab could
rebind the provider mid-session, that knowledge would depend on a control living in page
JavaScript — reachable by anything running in the page, which is precisely what the desktop
app's proof-of-user mechanism (DR-16) exists to prevent.

Fixing the refusal would have meant minting a user-action key somewhere a browser could reach
it. Leaving it in place means the operator chooses the provider once, at the terminal, before
anyone opens a tab — and the tier that choice implies holds for every session in that daemon.
A run started against an institutional Bedrock model is private for its whole life; one started
against a commercial model is public for its whole life. Neither can drift.

**Displaced alternatives.**

- *Mint a digest scoped to a loopback bind.* Rejected: it makes the guarantee depend on the
  bind address, so the same code path is safe or unsafe according to a flag, and the failure is
  silent.
- *A per-tab key.* Rejected: it puts the key in the page, which is the thing being avoided.
- *Pre-seed providers out of band and accept the refusal.* Adopted — this is the ruling.

**Consequence to accept.** The interface must explain the refusal rather than appear broken. A
disabled picker with a reason is the requirement; a 409 toast is not.

> **Why this closes an open question.** `docs/security/privacy-tiers-execution-plan.md` Open
> Question 23 left the headless case explicitly unruled, noting that such a deployment "has no
> GUI, so there is no process that can mint a key on the user's behalf." SD-1 answers it: none
> is minted, and the capability is withdrawn rather than approximated.

## SD-2 — Loopback by default; reaching it from another machine is an explicit act

**Ruling.** `biorouter serve` binds `127.0.0.1` unless told otherwise. A non-loopback bind must
be requested explicitly, and when it is, a browser token is mandatory rather than optional — the
command refuses to start without one.

**Why.** The default is the case that needs no threat model: a browser and a daemon on one
machine, reachable by nobody else. The remote case is real and supported, but it is a different
posture — the port is exposed to whatever network the interface is on — and the person taking it
should have said so.

Making the token mandatory on that path rather than merely available is the load-bearing half.
An optional credential on an exposed port is not a credential; it is a setting nobody changed.

**Consequence to accept.** There is no configuration that exposes the port without a token. An
operator who wants an unauthenticated LAN service has to put something else in front of it, and
that is the correct amount of friction.

## SD-3 — The daemon serves the interface; the reverse proxy is deleted

**Ruling.** `biorouterd` gains the ability to serve the built interface directly. The
reverse-proxying front door is removed, not fixed.

**Why.** Same-origin is not a tidiness argument, it is what makes three separate problems stop
existing:

- **WebSockets work.** `/ui/workspace` and `/apps/{id}/agent` are daemon routes. Reached
  same-origin they need no proxy support at all. Through the old proxy they could not work —
  the `Connection` header was stripped by the request allowlist, `upgrade()` was never called,
  and the inbound upgrade was never extracted. Any one of those was fatal, and the client
  retried forever rather than reporting it.
- **The credential stops being handled twice.** The proxy injected the daemon secret on behalf
  of whoever connected. With one process there is one secret and one place that checks it.
- **The interface's own endpoints land behind authentication.** They were previously served by
  a router with no auth layer at all.

The change removes more code than it adds: the proxy, the child-process supervisor, the
readiness poll and both header allowlists all go.

**Displaced alternatives.**

- *Keep the proxy, split the crate into a library and a thin binary.* Rejected: it preserves
  every problem above and adds a WebSocket-proxy rewrite plus a deliberate origin relaxation.
  Its one advantage — surviving an unreachable daemon — is worth nothing when the daemon is the
  product.
- *Ship the standalone binary on every platform.* Rejected; see SD-6.

## SD-4 — One serving shape: the interface is served at the root

**Ruling.** The interface is served at `/`. Serving it under a path prefix is not supported.

**Why.** The prefix mode existed to sit behind a reverse proxy at a subpath, and it cost a
disproportionate amount: the built bundle bakes root-absolute asset URLs into its JavaScript and
its stylesheets as well as its HTML, so supporting a prefix meant rewriting each of those and
registering per-asset routes for the rewritten copies. That machinery, and the bulk of the tests
around it, exists only to serve the prefix case.

Serving at the root makes the bundle's own URLs correct as built. An operator who needs Biorouter
at a subpath can give it a hostname instead — which is what a browser application with absolute
asset URLs wants anyway.

**Consequence to accept.** This removes a capability. It was reachable only by passing an
explicit flag, and the deployment it was built for disabled the proxy that would have used it.

---

## SD-5 — The verb is `serve`; `headless` remains as an alias

**Ruling.** `biorouter serve` is the command. `biorouter headless` is kept as an alias and
continues to work. Documentation leads with `serve` and mentions the alias once.

**Why.** `serve` says what the command does to someone who has never read this page. `headless`
describes the deployment it came from, and the word already means non-interactive prompt mode
elsewhere in the interface — a second meaning on the same word in the same command surface is a
cost paid by every reader.

Keeping the alias costs one line and protects anyone following existing instructions.

---

## SD-6 — The standalone binary and its Linux tarball are retired

**Ruling.** The `biorouter-headless` crate is removed. The
`biorouter-headless-linux-x64.tar.gz` release asset is removed with it. The release ships ten
assets rather than eleven.

**Why.** Once the daemon serves the interface (SD-3), the standalone binary has no remaining
job: it existed to spawn and proxy a daemon that now needs neither. Keeping it would mean
shipping a third executable in every artifact to duplicate a capability the daemon already has.

The distribution story is simpler as a result, and matches how the product is actually
installed: the desktop application for people who want a desktop application, and the
command-line packages for people who want a server — including the Linux command-line-only
packages, which carry no interface bundle overhead they cannot use.

**Consequence to accept.** The asset count assertion in the release script, the verification
phase, and the download page's filename list all move together. A drop from eleven to ten must
be deliberate in each place, because each is a tripwire designed to catch exactly this.

> **Note.** "Headless" is overloaded in the release scripts and means two unrelated things. The
> `cli-linux` packages are described as headless because they carry no graphical application;
> they are unaffected by this decision and continue to ship. What is retired is the separate
> browser-serving binary.

---

## SD-7 — `serve` spawns the daemon; the command-line interface does not link the server

**Ruling.** `biorouter serve` starts `biorouterd` as a child process. It does not run the
server in-process.

**Why.** `biorouter-cli` deliberately carries no dependency on `biorouter-server`, and the
boundary is documented at the one place that came closest to crossing it
(`crates/biorouter-cli/src/commands/session_watch.rs`, which duplicates a header constant rather
than import it). Running the server in-process would erase that boundary and merge two large
binaries into one.

Spawning also matches what the desktop application already does, so there is one supervision
model rather than two.

**Consequence to accept.** The child's standard input is closed rather than carrying a
proof-of-user digest. Under SD-1 that is the intended configuration, not a limitation — but it
means the daemon a `serve` session talks to is deliberately less capable than the one the
desktop application starts, and anything that assumes otherwise is wrong.

**And the child must never outlive the parent.** The daemon, not `serve`, holds the port,
answers the browser token and serves the shell carrying its secret, so a `serve` that exits
without stopping it has revoked nothing. `serve` therefore stops the daemon on every path it can
run code on, and on Unix starts it with `--exit-with-parent` so that it stops itself on the paths
`serve` cannot — see [how `serve` starts and stops the daemon](serve-architecture.md#how-serve-starts-and-stops-the-daemon).
A comment in `serve` claimed the first half from the start; until 2026-09 neither half was true,
and only a terminal's `Ctrl-C`, which signals the whole process group, ever reached the daemon.

---

## SD-8 — A control that can never work here says so, rather than failing on click

**Ruling.** Everything that depends on the proof-of-user digest SD-7 declines to install must
declare itself unavailable **before** the user acts on it, and the daemon's refusal must be
distinguishable from an ordinary "you did not prove this" refusal.

Concretely: `POST /action-required/tool-confirmation` answers a refused approval with a body
carrying `reason: "unproven"` or `reason: "noKeyInstalled"` and a sentence addressed to a person;
the approval card reads `isBrowserSurface()` up front and renders that sentence in place of its
Allow/Deny buttons; and the agent is not offered tools whose only path runs through such an
approval — the three skill mutations and the extension manager's install and delete are withheld
from the advertised roster when no person is reachable.

**Why.** SD-1 already required that *"the interface must explain the refusal rather than appear
broken"*, and stated it about the model picker. The same argument covers every proof-backed
control, and an approval card is the worst case: three buttons that look live, a bare 403 on
click, and a refusal written for an AI agent. Withholding the tools is the other half — a model
that proposes an install it can never finish has wasted a turn and taught the user that the
feature is broken rather than absent.

**What this is NOT.** It is not a security change. Nothing that was refused becomes permitted;
the gate in `confirm_tool_action` is unchanged in what it allows. This record is about a surface
telling the truth in advance, which is exactly the asymmetry the privacy work rests on: a user
who insists may proceed past a warning, but nothing proceeds automatically.

**Consequence to accept.** The advertised tool roster is now a function of how the daemon was
started, so two daemons on the same machine can offer different tools. The availability flag is
sampled once per roster and threaded, rather than re-read inside each declaration, so a roster
can never half-believe a person is reachable.
